### For creating each task for the Spring backlog, there were many decisions to be made. There is an importance to correclty breaking down the tasks so that there is enough work in each. I didn't feel that there was a need to add unit testing to the tasks as every implementation task involves testing. The decision on how many points for story pointing came from how many hours I estimated each task will take. This is a good way of planning the work and when to do it. For example, creating POJOs will take less time than implementing methods as it is mostly just generating getters and setters for variables. Implementing actual computational methods involves more thinking and time. 
### The Velocity metric is a great way for a team to manage their work and plan for future sprints. A sprint velocity is the number of story points a team estimates they can complete in a single sprint. At the end of each sprint, the completed story points are totalled which then feeds into the planning for the future.
